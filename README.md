# Star-Wars-Map-in-Endless-Sky
The current goal is to have every system from Star Wars Legends placed as accurately as
possible (within reason), and to have sector borders, trade routes, and important
astronomical features such as the Void of Chopani labled.

The orange systems are systems that appear in canon, and the blue systems are systems
that appear exclusively in Legends.  Many of the most important systems such as Hoth
and Byss appear in both Canon and Legends, and are thus orange.  For this reason, some
orange systems have been added to the map while others have been left alone.

Many systems do not have exact locations given in any official map, and liberty has been
taken in a few instances where perfectly accurate placement of systems would result in
unreadable system names due to how close together those systems are.  See the Tharin
sector for an example, the space in and around the Periphary region in particular.  It
can be searched for in game by searching for the Dles system just above Hutt Space.
Note how the systems in that area do not line up with the systems on the inserted
screenshots.
